# birthday
a simple html page, enter your birthday and it will show you the which day of the week it is at each year

## note:
the code does NOT have any comments because I didn't spend that much of time on it, so it was an instant for-fun project, but i had a really enjoy coding it

## how does it work??
Zeller's congruence, it look like some nonsense word right??
wel according to wikipedia "Zeller's congruence is an algorithm devised by Christian Zeller to calculate the day of the week for any Julian or Gregorian calendar date.
It can be considered to be based on the conversion between Julian day and the calendar date."
so basically it is a mathematical algorithm that return the number in the range (0,6) which represent the index of this array:
["saturday", "sunday", "monday", "tuesday", "wendsday", "thursday", "friday"]
simple right?? well not totaly, it have some Exceptions when using in a code.
feel free to read the wikipedia page for more information:
